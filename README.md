# Hello, welcome to the repository for my Word Clock project, this ReadMe is where I will explain what each file in the repository does.

Make sure to download this library for the code to work --> https://github.com/3tawi/PicoEspTime //LIBRARY DOWNLOAD HERE!!!

actualclock.ino - This is the code to get the internal rtc in the rp2040 to run on its own, it prints time in the serial monitor and stores all time values as objects under "rtc."xxxx"", can be set with  srtf time or unix epoch

clockplusnpxl.ino - This is the main test document that I make all edits for the project in, essentially a place-holder for the final version of the code while the file doesn't exist, the MOST changes will be found here

all_non-number_words_final.ino - the final version of the code for powering ALL non-number words (it, is, minutes, to, past, o'clock)
